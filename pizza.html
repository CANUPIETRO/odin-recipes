        STEP 1<p></p>
         Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt.<p></p>
         Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, <p></p>
         fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. <p></p>
         You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust.<p></p>

        STEP 2<p></p>
        Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste.<p></p> 
        Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.<p></p>

        STEP 3<p></p>
        Roll out the dough: if you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. <p></p>
        On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. <p></p>
        The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.<p></p>

        STEP 4<p></p>
        Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. <p></p>
        Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. <p></p>
        Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season.<p></p>
        Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray.<p></p>
        Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using. <p></p>
        Repeat step for remaining pizza.<p></p>
